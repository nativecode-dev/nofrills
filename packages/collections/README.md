### Deprecations
`Chain` and `ChainAsync` have been deprecated in [3.5.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nofrills/collections/v/3.5.0). A new package, [@nofrills/patterns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nofrills/patterns) was created in order to consolidate the various abstract patterns in use throughout the libraries.
