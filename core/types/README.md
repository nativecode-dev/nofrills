# Introduction

`@nofrills/types` is a library that provides a consistent runtime type checking for JavaScript instances. In addition to basic types, such as `string`, `boolean`, etc, `types` also supports more complex type definitions, such as custom types. You can register your own types and ensure that your runtime instances truly match definitions you specify.

## Is

Use the `Is` helper to validate basic types, such as `string`, `boolean`, `Date`, etc.

```javascript
const isDate = Is.date(Date.now()) // false
const isNumber = Is.number(Date.now()) // true
const isString = Is.string('this is a string') // true
```

```typescript
const isDate: boolean = Is.date(Date.now()) // false
const isNumber: number = Is.number(Date.now()) // true
const isString: boolean = Is.string('this is a string') // true
```

## ObjectNavigator

## Types

Use the `Types` registry to retrieve or add type definitions for the runtime to validate.

```javascript

```

```typescript
```

# FAQ

## Q: What is the difference between `Is` and `Types`?

### A: The `Is` helper is meant to be a basic type checker for primitives while `Types` is meant to be used as a custom type validator.
